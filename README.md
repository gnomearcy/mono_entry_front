This is the frontend side of mono_app.
Backend side can be found [here](https://github.com/gnomearcy/mono_entry).

The aim of this project is showcase of full stack app development for first time.

At point of making, previous technical knowledge can be viewed from completed projects:
- Android development (3 years)
- WebGL game written in [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/) ([repo](https://github.com/gnomearcy/masters_game))
- Portofolio page written in ReactJS ([repo](https://github.com/gnomearcy/gnomearcy.github.io), [live](https://gnomearcy.github.io))

Goals:
- write backend stack (database, API) in .NET using C#
- write frontend component web app using Angular2
